### The Organization

Doing business is to pursue a goal with bulding an organization to achieve the goal together. So building the right organization is the key to our success.

##### The people structures

At the begining, no need much investments, we only need me(owner) and another man (a christian).

##### The Shares structure

There are two kind for the shares, first for ownership, owner is responsible for the company's direction, the owner's share does not have money value, I am the owner of this company. Another man who is responsible for company's dialy operation under company's expense will be a manager of the company.

 Second is for the people who do the work, the employees share the 90% to 80% profit of the company, when the employee leaves, he or she can not take away the share.
