### Remote Work

First, I believe remote work (work from home not working together in an office) is possible, challengs remain. Work remotely have a lot of benefits, one is obviousely to save office rent, another is the country border used to limit people no use any more. In order to be competitive, the success remote work is not simple, it is challengable , learn from world famous remote work company (some of them have over one thousand employees,like gitlab.com, github.com, more and more companies work remotely,some of them are very big,they even do not have an office. ), here are some I learned from gitlab.com (there are over one thousand 3 hundred emplyees, their sharing are very valueable.):

##### Shared Value

Mutual trust and common value are in christian faith, I believe the christian faith is fit for digital practices.

##### Transparency

No secrtes among work,everything suppose to be transparency. Everyone is transperant in work either to each other or to customers.Turn the company to emplyees holding company.

In practice, there is no standard procedure in remote work space, we have to try by ourselves.

1. Communications

In order to win in competition, communications are very important, Clear mutual understanding and rules by both parties are the key.

2. Hand Book

The guide on how to start a remote work. A success remote work will not happen autopilot, rules are needed.

Because we are used to face to face communications, we are trained for that purpose, means if we want to work remotely well,we have to abandon the old habits. 

3. Everything record

If you want to communicate well under a limit budget, you have to appoint rules between two parties, and the rules enhence mutial trust. Not only for present talking need, it is necessary to leave a record to check afterward, every work related record whether it is chat or working memo or working comment can searchable.

4. Asynchronous Communications

We have to redefine speed, during digital transformation, the old rules are abandoned, in digial sale, speed is less important among value, trust, communicate asynchronous means you can not expect everyone else take part with you, and you have to treat yourself as team leader, to comlete the work independently.
