### Learnning from gitlab.com

[gitlab.com](https://www.gitlab.com) has totally over one thousand three hundreds employees working remotely in the world,no office at all, that prove working remotely is possible, only need some conditions, gitlab.com call himself the world largest remote company, which means it is on very beginning stage on remote working area. gitlab.com shares some pratices, which are inspired:

1. Values

The company like gitlab.com, the value is on its first place to be a productive company, they call it 'CREDIT', some other companies may call value as culture or enterprise culture, aim to increase the employees' productive to gain more profits, in order to make the share more fat and companies running more smoothly. We have christian faith, I believe Jesus' commands are more powerful than cultures.

2. [Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook)

When someone newly onboarding, to follow a common social codes are keys to colaboration, it is often done by mentorship face to face. In my opinion the handbook is a guide to new comer to let him take part in a new team, the gitlab.com's handbook has over 10,000 pages, too long to read, what I want is a much shorter one, focusing colaboration.

3. Asynchronous Communications

It is totally redefinit the speed, how the speed defined inside an organization, if Asynchronous Communications proceed, then the speed is not on the top priority list, I think the Asynchronous Communications is very revolutionary in working remotely area, It has to reshap the working process during working remotely, not simply copy the office style, if not, then surely will loss in competition.

### Working remotely in our company

We can not simply imated the gitlab.com approches, not only because we are in different stages, but also because of different priorities.

1. Christian Faith 

Chistian faith is the cornerstone of our approch to working remotely, chritian faith that is believing in Jesus Christ have honest, trust, transperency,colaboration, all nessasory to work remotely,so if one believe God truely,he will perform well in remote work.

2. Transperency

No secretes, no business secretes at all, always be true each other.

3. Handbook

There is a place to meet the requirements among working remotely, the rule to make the new member to communicate well with the other team members.

4. Reading

 Working not by face to face, we need writing to communicate each other,thus we may need more patient more careful to read, the main communicate channel we use is email, and internet are decreasing our ability to focus, to read carefully is a main abilty towards engneer,that is also a big demand of our business.

5. Asynchronous Communications

When asynchronous communications works, it is very suitable for working remotely, that means people in a team has to make a decision by himself, meanwhile no colleague by his side, he has to work on his own, and share the record within the team to review.

6. Training

If I see the processes moldular, then the full processes were composed with different sub-process, then some crucial processes are replayable and can be replayed by training to simulate the process advance.

Training is good for company to accumulate their skills and knowledg. Also good for work remotely. So the speed is not the competition advantages any more.

### What we do when working remotely

Once a writer called it 'fifth or sixth industrial revolution', says the border between countries disappear, the border is good for politician's job but there is no border in remote work realm. The remote work make the border disappear reallity, before the virus pandmeic, I thought maybe software companies will adopt remote work, that suggest live is bigger than work, now you can see. remote work is everywhere, no matter it is a developed or underdeveloped economy.

Take an example, when we want do business with transducer repair, first the whole procedure can be divided into several sub-processes, the whole procedures are: transducer repair,contract signing, billing, deliveryes, repair in vendor. First of all, you shall demostrate the whole process. 

Let us simulate the transducer repair process, first ask how to inspect on site by ultrasound operator, is it possible? Is it simple enough to be operated by Ultrasound operator without engineer's intervention? If answer is true, then how to make it happen?

First, the process is shown on website,to let the reader inspects by himself, then if there is a requirement to inspect regulerly, then that can be decided by operator, recommendation will be 6-8 months, with direction on how to store the transducer,  then the transducer repair section is over, then we go to next section, signing contract.
