### The Sales

##### The sales channels

Presume there are onle advertising medias availible for medical imaging professionals  we can do online advertisings.

For transducers repair work we can do a quick proccess, by signing agreement online, no need to go to costumer's hospital or clinic in order to save money.

The sale of second hand ultrasound machine will take longer, our profit mainly comes from second hand ultrasound machine sale and new or preowned transducer sale, as well as the networking work.

Regarding the network solution in medical imaging, there is one globle standard available, called 'DICOM', software which run DICOM file called PACS, the problem is the vendors sale the software too expensive only big hospital can afford, there is open source alternatives, the costumers should have this kind need, mostly it is small hopital or clinic.

The networking setup is actually set up a internal server, whether it is deploying internal or deploying on cloud, the structures are first linux operating system, then install Docker, then install server software, maybe it is called 'dcm4chee',then connect server to imaging machine, on the physician's end may need installing a DICOM Reader software, whether it is Windows version or Linux version,I installed the softwares years ago, so it is not a problem. I think it is better to ask costumers to pay service charge, then the customer pay what we supported, as well as the yearly support charge, they like to pay rather than salling softwares to them.

##### The customers

Keep in mind, we are not a company to sell our solutions, the services we provide to our customers are help our customers win in competition, so the only standard to evaluate our service is our customers winning or lossing in competition.

##### The diferences between trational business practices and digital one

1. From the ownership perspective, the traditional way is to maxmium the share holder's benefit, the gain with the share holder means the loss for customer as well as the employee.

The digital way see from competition perspective, the main goal we saught is to survive in competition, so the share structure, the purpose to do business have to be changing.

2. The traditional way doing business for profit, so they will improve gradually, but in digital way, we think differents, from competition perspective, we decrease the price dramertically in order to obtain a better competition position, not decrease a bit gradually but sudenly.

3. The way treat customer different, in traditional way, doing business for profit, they treat customer as rival, but in digital way, the trust based on reputation, the reputation guarded by your competitor(generally if you act false, you will lose your customer), always be true is a wise strategy not only we want to be,also because we have to be.Not only to our coworker but customers also. We have to stand with our customers on one side.
