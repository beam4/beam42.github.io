#### Backgroud

In business, today we face fierce competition in everyway, either from producs and organization, or the way we run business, if we follow the way running business according to our own sight, I am sure we will fail.

I believe the old generation is replacing by new generetion of business rules,called digital transformation, there is a good chance to start a new business, but if you act from your own personality,to compete against existing player and with unknown forthcoming competitors, you will definitly can not survive in competition, what to do? To follow the Christian Way is the only chance to survive,cause it claims it is vivid. It is true and it is life and you believe as it claim to be.  

#### Jesus Christ is our value

This business is based on top of the christian faith, in order to survive in fierce competition, we don't have to live on our own, which we are doomed to fail, we follow the mighty god, he is superior above all things.

Some companies claim they have culture, that is a attempt trying to build a set of rules called cultures to survive in competition,that is phychological hint try giving the same identity to all persons, that is not real,it is false.

But believing in Christ, share the mighty god to become unbeatable,cause you share the unbeatable name.

In Christ, you will have:

- Trust, Jesus acts as a mediator between believers whether they know each other or did not meet face by face, that is where trust come from, so 'It always protects, always trusts,always hopes,always perseveres.' 1 Corinthians 13:7
- Transparency, 'There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. Mathew 10:26'
- The trust and transparency are very key to working remotely.
- And many more... 

#### To be digitalized

Apart from the christian value, we have to stick with the digital approach,because the old rules, the traditional approach is abandoned and new rule is replacing, nobody will like to apply an outdated approach temporary, to be competitive, youy have to whatever try digital approaches, digital approaches usually have many forms, some of those are:

- Online advertising
- Online marketplaces

The traditional approaches relay on salespersons or traditional sales channel, the advertising is expensive for small business, but digital approaches run different way, it mainly relay on advertising,and geographic location within local business and analytics available to make the advertising outcome more perfect.

In digital sales, there are much differences, the sales appear many channels, called omnichannel, another sales channel is marketplace, some of it apears like amozon marketplace,some look like the old second hand marketplace,user can search and buy and sell items.The key point in digital approach is to follow the user, where there are numbers, where lays value.The user numbers mean value.

Beside sales, internet changed many aspects the business used to be, for example, you have to think competition every moment,the cost is ultimate weapon in competition,you have to make your cost low enough to have profits and make price low enough to resist your competitor from the business. 

#### Remote Work

We will work remotely, working remotely not only save office rent costs,but also leave us many challenges. Here are some points I think much more important,

- Chistian Faith
- Transparency 
- Handbook
- Reading
- Training

Chistian faith is cornerstone to working remotely. Transparency is in the center of a smoothly collaboration, handbook is the start point to know the rules in a team, to collaborating more as you know each other well, all communications are text base,so reading carefullly is much crucial to better collaboration, also, all documents and knowladges are in text,so reading are fundamental in engineering work.

Working remotely base on individul decision making, it is closely effected by other's opinion in team, so collect good informations are very key to a better remote work. Every consequences need well planed before it undertaken,so the training is making remote work easier.
