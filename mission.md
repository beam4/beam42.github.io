### The business GOAL:

Our goal is to bring low-cost imaging solution to physicians, the physicians (doctors who are responsable for diagnostics) have demands to increase their diagnostics more accurate in medical imaging, we can provide ultrasound transducers repair, if those can not meet their needs, we have second-hand ultrasound machine,then we can provide new or preowned ultrasound transducer, then we can provide low cost PACS imaging solution.

All those solutions are to significantly decrease the cost for imaging service meanwhile the affordable PACS solution will increase our customer's competitive advantage. 

The competition force hospital or clinic to increase their reputations, one of reputations comes from diagnostics accuracy, there are various products in market, but most of them are either expensive or lack of transparency, our goal is providing low cost ultrasound transducer repair service to hospital or clinics, make the services affordable and transparency, incuding second hand ultrasound machine and transducer sales. We stand on our customers' point of view to make the complexity become a simplier solution.
