The ultimate goal is bringing available medical imaging to doctorâ€™s desktop, through netwotking technologies.

We provide ultrasound service to reduce the cost of ultrasound imaging.

Then for multi resources medical imaging to improve the acurate of diagnostic,the networking technologies can solve the problem, it is like setting up a internal server for Dicom file to store and retrieve, there are open source projects out there, I tried some years ago,today with dockerized images, it would be easier.
