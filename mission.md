All those solutions are to significantly decrease the cost for medical imaging service meanwhile the affordable PACS solution will increase our customer's competitive advantage. 

The competition force hospital or clinic to increase their reputations, one of reputations comes from diagnostics accuracy, there are various products in market, but most of them are either expensive or lack of transparency, our goal is providing low cost ultrasound solution to hospital or clinics.
