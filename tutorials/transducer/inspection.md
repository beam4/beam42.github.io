### Transducer site inspection DIY

Among cable repair or crystal dead or lens broken, will cause image quality decline, there is a black line reflecting on screen . The cause is the disconctivity to the piezoelectric material which is a thin layer on the probe.The lens broken is similar to disconect to piezoelctric which transit and recieve the ultrasound then reflect on screen.

##### The methodology to distinguish crystal dead from lens broken

**crystal dead** and **lens broken** all appear on the screen as black line,means ultrsound not funtioning well on that point, whether it is singel crystal or several crystals, it doesn't matter, it cause quality decline will severe effect the diagnostic accurity, furthermore can not be judged by eyes only can be tested in factory.

**First we have to detect the crystal did not function well, it always comes from the operator's feel, suspect the image quality decline, but first spot the suspection real, because normal imaging can not see any problem.

Step1, connect the suspect transducer, aplly a thin layer of ultrasound gel.

Step2, adjust the 'Depth' button minimum and 'Gain' button to appropriate level, to make the disconectivity on screen as obviusly as possible. In this case, the Depth is 1.78cm.

Step3, if can view black line on the screen, then prove your suspicion, otherwise, there are other reason cuase the problem. Press 'Freeze' button to make the image photo shot or keep a thermal printer copy.

##### How to distinguish crystal dead from lens broken

The crystal dead is similar to lens broken, all appear on screen as ultrasound not function well, reflect on screen as disconnection, there is black line on screen, on transducer side, we can not detect with our eyes, the crystal dead or weak is still, meanwhile the lens broken is moveable and often visible, as air leakage in the transducer surface, then try to move the lens broken point and observe the screen, to see if the black line move in accordance with the lens broken movement.

If black line moves with lens broken, then it is sure the lens broken cause the black line, if the black line is still, does not move with the lens broken point, it is probably the crystal problem, final judged by factory, usually the price of crystal repair is 5 times more than lens repair, for example the crystal repair was 6000RMB compare with 1000RMB(equivalent USD143 inexchange rate 7) with lens repair at the time 10 years ago,now maybe half.So the trust between our customer and us is very crucial, no matter we try to please the customer, lower the cost is our job.

##### Transducer care advices

The trancdusers are piezo marterial inside, please handle with gentle, don't conflict with hard surface, for transducer inspection, better on 2 basis, 1 is when the operator feel the image quality decline, another is conduct an annual inspection. Follow the Steps above.
