##### Data tells the truth

Digital shift comes with fierce competation, live or die, we must choose in front of time, no one can hide.

Website and ERP combined provide digital companies need, we presume that you have had a website. Our mission is to provide affordable ERP to companies, as well as saving spend on cloud base applications.

Digitalization is a sales term, compare to traditional business we get used to, digitalizing a company means turn visible to metrics represent your business,  this way free the ability of management, either from competation pespective or from management, you have to increase your management or competitiveness.

Cloud and Open Source are answer to low priced ERP deployment, to use data,  you have to own data first, that is where binesness applications come in, data is crucial to our business but not software, we have to know how to use it. 

##### How to use data

Website and erp are different role in company digitalization, website often act in company sales, erp notes down every business raleted records,  we want to use data to represent our business status, say using metrics instead presence by your self with your eyes. Usually we treat if we know customers better, we will have competetive advantage against our competator. The traditional way is guessing work, more experienced often means more accurate. But in digital era, we use data to achieve in traditional way often accurate but expensive way, the customers are out there, in digital era, you can not wait, you have to move. You have to judge the customers preferences by designing a campaign to attract customers show their preference, all you want to know is customers's preferences, you have to achieve that among website (website only provide the contens you promopt your sales) and data analyse (we connect website with Google Analytics to analyse the customers preferences comparing your history data to fine tune until satisfied.) by designing a web compaign.

ERP goes similar way, because erp is internal application, it will not connect Google Analytics, it has data analyse feature, in Odoo UI, go to 'Reporting' , there you will find data analysis, it usually use only one or two filters to query data, for example, today's sales on different locations, best sale item, that also means data use is simple,  cloud Look it up implement means you can know your business realtime. ERP is fundamental to today's company digitalization.
