Digitalization means to represent with metrics instead monitoring by your own eyes, you have to understand business through metrics, software to make your business digital and the organization align with digital reality, the fierce competition force us to do so.

Website and erp are different role in company digitalization, website often act in company sales, erp notes down every business raleted records,  we want to use data to represent our business status, say using metrics instead presence by your self with your eyes. Usually we treat if we know customers better, we will have competetive advantage against our competator. The traditional way is guessing work, more experienced often means more accurate. But in digital era, we use data to achieve in traditional way often accurate but expensive way, the customers are out there, in digital era, you can not wait, you have to move. You have to judge the customers preferences by designing a campaign to attract customers show their preference, all you want to know is customers's preferences, you have to achieve that among website (website only provide the contens you promopt your sales) and data analyse (we connect website with Google Analytics to analyse the customers preferences comparing your history data to fine tune until satisfied.) by designing a web compaign.

ERP goes similar way, because erp is internal application, it will not connect Google Analytics, it has data analyse feature, in Odoo UI, go to 'Reporting' , there you will find data analysis, it usually use only one or two filters to query data, for example, today's sales on different locations, best sale item, that also means data use is simple,  cloud Look it up implement means you can know your business realtime. ERP is fundamental to today's company digitalization.

We use cloud server alone with Open Source applications like operating system Linux, docker containers, database to ERP Odoo, a line of Open Source applications to save license cost.

1. Cloud server we use AWS EC2
2. Operating system we use Ubuntu Linux
3. Docker container installed
4. Database is PostgreSQL,free Open Source database.
5. ERP our choice  is open Source ERP Odoo 

###### Practice

1) The technology progress provide the envoroiment

Cloud and Open Source provide the possibilities and  crucial, demands in cloud show small business try to figure out the way to try to alaign with digital transfermation. 

2) The production installation prove it is practical, not fiction. 

We first installed in 2012 on linode.com, start production use from October, 2013. Then shift cloud provider to Ali Cloud in 2015, now it run under a cloud server in AWS Beijing, it is running under docker container after update to AWS after March 2017.
