### How is this pratical

We have two persepetives, one is techonologies, another is based on our activity.

### Technology

We use cloud server alone with Open Source applications like operating system Linux, docker containers, database to ERP Odoo, a line of Open Source applications to save license cost.

1. Cloud server we use AWS EC2
2. Operating system we use Ubuntu Linux
3. docker container installed
4. Database is PostgreSQL,free Open Source database.
5. ERP our choice  is open Source ERP Odoo 

### Practice

1) The technology progress provide the envoroiment

Cloud and Open Source provide the posibilities, and  increasing demands in cloud show small business try to figure out the way to try to alaign with digital transfermation. 

2) The production installation of this process prove it is practical, not fiction. 

We first installed in 2012 on linode.com, start production use from October, 2013. Then shift cloud provider to Ali Cloud in 2015, now it run under a cloud server in AWS Beijing, it is running under docker container after update to AWS after March 2017.
