### What we are going to do (The scope of work)

**The Transducer Repairs**

We may start from transducer repairs, with quick proccess (with no site engineer involved, the customer will do site inspection themselves,then sign agreement online, deliver the transducer themselves, recieve repaired transducer themselves, all by instructions on website, in order to save customer's cost.) . The transducer repairs mostly are lens repair.

**Transducer Or Ultrasound Machine Replacement**

Then if the transducer repairs do not meet customer's need, we may offer them new or used transducer, if they want to buy ultrasound machine,we can offer used ultrasound machine, in this stage,the customer's information is very crucial, we may offer the customer's most fit solution according to the information.

**Medical Imaging Networking**

The imaging networking work are little bit different, once we are ready we have to look for a customer,usually it is a small hospital or clinic, the low cost DICOM server to store all diagnostics images and view on doctor's desk, may attractive to hospital.

### The process

For marketing, the transducer repair cover all models and brands, I want to make the transducer repair help us to build reputation of low cost solution in ultrasound,so I presume all the work can be done online, without engineers intervention in order to save cost, including sale through online advertising, diagnostic transducer condition by online document by themseves, sign repair contract online, after repair installation by themseves. The gain mainly come from second hand ultrasound and networking work, we serve our costumers with true promise never cheat in work, finding a better solution to solve their problems, regardless their attitude.

The second hand ultrasound's costumers mainly come from our reputation we build through the whole process, the networking's costumers may be concern with the second hand ultrasound costumers.

For technology, our full techology stackes are based on open source technology,which including Cloud, Linux server, Docker, Applications like Jekyll, dcm4chee, Odoo ERP. 

And for remote work, we recommend as simple as possible, we recommend gitlab.com as intranet, google gmail as email.

### The path we are going through

Work remotely and online advertising are crucial to our business.

Work remotely are considered the future of work, means we can not relay on any previous experieces, we have to build from blank. A long way to go.

Online advertisings are crucial to our survival, first have to try and find appropriate channel, sell face to face is traditional way, we have to sell digital way rather than traditional way.

### The initial sales plan

I think I can pursuade Chinese transducer repair supplier to setup a fecility in India, in a short time after we start. I think India market is attactive.

The online advertising are suppose to help us to sale ultrasound machines, I will negotiate with a Canada company as well as an american company to sale their invetotry to let us have commission from sales, by exchange I can provide free digital advice for small business, I think it is attractive.I will do it shortly after we start.

The images networking cusomer may come from used ultrasound,the networking work may take longer time than sale work.
