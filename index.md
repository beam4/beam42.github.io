### Remote Work

Work remotely is not only a buzzword in front us, it real challenge. Remote work is at the core to evalue what we get.

#### From value layer:

It should be a transparent company, information is power, no called cmmercial secrets inside.In order to implement value layer, here are rules.

##### 1. Transparency

No secrtes among work acts,everything suppose to be transparency,this require businee structure rebuilt, abandon shareholders structures,turn to emplyees hold share. Turn the company to emplyees holding company.

##### 2. Communications

Each party in a communication should mind, there is a need to record, in order to let other people know the matter clear, that is asynchronous purposed to. Also ther is a need to definite what the urgent is. 

Practice layers:

##### 1. Hand Book

The guide on how to start a remote work. A new user suppose to have a gmail account, for email corepondents,and google other services,a gitlab.com account to use company intranet, and communicate with gitlab issues.

Because we are used to face to face communications, we are trained for that purpose, means if we want to work remotely well,we have to abandon the habits. 

##### 2. Everything record

If you want to communicate well under a limit budget, you have to appoint rules between two parties, and the rules enhence mutial trust. Not only for present talking need, it is necessary to leave a record to check afterward, every work related record either it is chat or working memo or working comment can searchable.

##### 3. Asynchronous Communications

When you approach your work in this manner, it's less chaotic. The sense of urgency is not on rushing something out, but on the thoroughness and thoughtfulness in documentation. â€” Darren M., GitLab

#### The Steps

We start from transducer repair, I knew the Chinese repair companies in Shenzhen,I need to confirm afterwards. The other repair companies from US and Korea I used to work with, but I am afaid they can not compete with the price I will cofirm anyway.

Then I want to neogotiate with a certain second hand company for saling preowned ultrasound machine for commission, because we initial satrt,lacking of money, I am confidence they will agree, for exchange, I can provide free networking technology consulting service to the company.

Regarding sales of ultrasoung service,we have to try online advertising other than face to face visit.On initial stage, there may be few visits required, but mainly we relay on online advertising. For online channels, I have no ideas at the moment, but there suppose to be a medical imaging site or social site for medical professionals.

For networking service we will talk later, after the ultrsound work became stable.
