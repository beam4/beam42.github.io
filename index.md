1. Transducer (probe scanhead) Repair

Mainly it is lens repair service,

We may start from lens repair, ten years ago, it was about USD150 each, its US conterpart offer USD1000 with test( I fergot the exact amount) the south korea repair facility also derive from USA technology.

We can focus on lens repair, even from imaging quality perspective, the genuine and non-genuine transducer almost have no visible differents, the customer may like genuine transducer,  we can offer used or new( in some occasions) genuine transducer, even it is 10 times higher.In the future, I think we can persuade a Chinese repair vendor to set a lens repair facility in India, I think the lens repair is simple.

1. New or preowned genuine transducer and preowned ultrasound machine, I will negotiate with a Canada company and a USA company who are selling ultrasound, in order to take commission.

1. The imaging networking service, there is potencial that imaging networking becoming premier work. The customer's demand may focus on networking.

#### The sales path suppose like this:

First experiment,then go online advertising, first experiment to testify the idea or concept in a small experiment group, a handful local small hospitals or clinics will be ok, then find an appropriate online sale channel.

#### About speed

Keep it in mind, we are not a selling company,sale solution to our cusomers, we are solving customers technical problem, our solution suppose to be complicated and time consuming, but deliver to customer should be simple and easy to operated. So speed is not our first priority.
