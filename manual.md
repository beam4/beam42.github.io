When we want to do works together, we actually wnat our collaboration go smoothly, because the good collaborations mean better chances to survive in firece competition, that is why we need to follow common code or rules.

We need our rules to work together, in order that new one can follow the rule, to ensure building the mutual trusts.

##### general notice

Reading is a very essential ability, because most communications are taken with no face to face, second, reading carefully is the essential for engineer.

One should agree with no commercial secretd at all, that do not mean no need personal privacy, we have to follow what Jesus said to his disciples: 'There is nothing concealed that will not disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.(Matthew 10:26), so keeping the work place transparency is very important, good communications but not hiding is very imortant to business survival.

##### general workfloes

We will work remotely, with no office at all.For ultrasound transducer repair work, we will not repair by our selves, we only act as a sales agent. For used ultrasound sales work, it mostly like second hand car business. So without an office, the communication is very important.No need mature engineer to know ultraound from the begining, we provide necessary training enough to do the works. 

1.One should have an google account(gmail account), 

2. One should use that gmail account to regeister an [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up) account, we use gitlab.com as an intranet(Internal internet for employees).

##### Rule for communication

Meet Face by face, with video call, because Jon has speaking problem, he may prefer mail.

Video Meeting, probably use Google meet or Zoom

Need to keep notes, in order to keep the record, I recommend use google Doc, share function.

We will share everything in intranet,includ emails. to keep transparency.
