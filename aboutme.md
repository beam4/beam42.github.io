![Me](/img/portrait.png)

I believe we are in time of change, the new order of the world is emerging, it was called digital transformation, while the traditional practices fade away, there are few things strange in my mind:

1. The mechanism of believing changed, previously we want to judge by ourselves, first we need to collect infomations then give our judges, but in digital practices, we need to follow different mechanism, it was called base on reputation, believing is similar with that of Christian faith,not based on judgment, one reason maybe there are complex things towards the truth, one person can not handle to make judgment.

2. The  consciousness prove to exist, you don't need to teach which is white or which is black if conciousness exist,conciousness exist lead to creation exist, good conciousness lead to Christian faith. The creation make sense that people are created with a purpose, so the digital transformation is for Christian faith who believe the purpose and pursue it.

3. Work remotely became  popular, previously I thought some categories may work on remotely,like tech industry, after virus lockdown, we dicovered that health concerns overcome cultures, working from home become new norm, that means the offices build for large organizations will be abandoned.

The business I want to carry is ultrsound medical image services, most of it are proven, it is not only letting poeple live on it,but also can support church doing their work.
