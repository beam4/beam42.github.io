![Me](/img/portrait.png)

We are in time of change, the change was brought by internet, the digital rules are replacing the traditional rules we familiar to, the global startups surge can prove this happening. My own experience make me to believe God exist,rather than proclaiming living God on paper,someone claims he is his own master, it is not true. If it is true, why people doubt his own existence?  What is the purpose of life? I want to be a financial branch on the road to evanglist.

I want to invite a chritian to take part in to operate the business in India market with me, the christian faith, the remote work are part of fondations of this work, the business we are going to carry on mostly based on what we had done before, it is feasible and proven.
